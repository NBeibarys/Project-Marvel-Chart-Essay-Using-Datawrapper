# Marvel Cinematic Universe: Decline in Critical and Financial Performance
This project explores how Marvel’s film reputation and profitability declined after Avengers: Endgame (2019), using data-driven storytelling through sequential visualization. The goal was to link audience perception, critic ratings, and box-office performance to reveal long-term trends in the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s reputation and financial efficiency.

## Project Structure
- `data.csv` - Contains compiled data on Marvel movies, including release years, Rotten Tomatoes (Critics & Audience) scores, IMDb ratings, Metacritic scores, worldwide box office revenue, and production budgets. 
This dataset was manually combined from public sources to compare audience perception, critic reception, and financial performance across MCU Phases 1-5.
- `Data Sources` - Rotten Tomatoes, IMDb, Metacritic, Box Office Mojo.
- `Deliverable` - A 3-part data visualization illustrating the relationship between critical reception, audience sentiment, and return on investment (ROI).

## Key Insights
- Identified a post-2019 divergence between audience and critic ratings, signaling early reputation erosion.
- Analyzed revenue data to reveal how financial performance lagged after the drop in critical reception.
- Demonstrated that Marvel’s ROI peaked during Phase 3 but declined steadily through Phases 4–5, suggesting diminishing brand efficiency.
